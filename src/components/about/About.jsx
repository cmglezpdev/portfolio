                        Hi! My name is Carlos Manuel Gonz√°lez and I am a student of Computer Science at the University of Havana. <br />
                        I really love running, going out with my friends. I'm very curious and I keep in continuous learning about the things that I like. <br />
                        I'm passionate about web development, cryptocurrencies and machine learning, but currently I'm enfoced on web development. <br />
                        I started programming when have 16 years old in the competitive programming. I have been 3 years focused only on that and participated in many national and international competitions from my preuniversity. <br />

                        When I ingresed in the university I started to interest more in web development, and I come to develop applications both frontend and backend. <br />
                        I haven't had any real laboral experience yet, but I'm open to the learning and work and collaborate with a company or another developer that wants to work with me. <br />
